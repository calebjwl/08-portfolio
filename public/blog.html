              <p class="card__body">The first day of anything new is bound to feel scary and foreign. While I had already visited the Iron Yard for the interviews as well as a Javascript Crash Course, nothing could have prepared me for what an actual lesson day at the Iron Yard would be like. Admittedly, I was completely overwhelmed at the requirements for the first homework assignment. Yet, through bouts of frustration and repeated trial and error, I found myself slowly putting together the pieces of this daunting puzzle.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="card__body">Day two allowed me te realize the benefits of the frenzy that was day one. During the lecture, I was able to build further knowledge into topics I didn't even realize I retained. Since I had to solve the first homework assignment through my own trials and errors, the lessons I had learned were more deeply engrained through the experience alone; the second assignment was no different. Further, I was able to better prepare myself for the lecture after realizing how much of it would be put into practice for the lab. By the end of the day, I had went from barely knowing the function of a class to being able to build a full website.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="card__body">The box model review assignment was refreshing in two ways. First, the fundamentals of the assignment was loosely based on concepts and practices we had already learned in day two. Second, we learned new info that would allow us to more effectively use those concepts. Everything I had learned and practiced this day further solidified concepts I had already known as well as those I was still unsure about. Moreover, I was able to see how this knowledge directly applied to many media I commonly use today.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="card__body">The position layout assignment taught me not only how to position fixed   elements on a page, but also how to better break down sections of code when considering the end goal for whichever website design I wanted to create. This skill allowed me to better understand the overall HTML and CSS structures. Moreover, I was able to see how these design principles might be applied into some of my favorite video games.</p>
